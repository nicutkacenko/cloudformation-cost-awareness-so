The resources were not deployed already, so former2 wouldn't work. My current ask is to help integrate Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines with AWS CloudFormation. The requirement is to have the stuff pulled from Azure DevOps to CloudFormation where the IaC is then deployed. Part of this involves transforming some CLI code to CloudFormation as mentioned above but now I'm stuck on integrating Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines with Cloudformation - can't even find much info about this setup online.", "CreationDate": "2021-12-20T09:05:56.617", "UserId": "17689147", "filtered-sentences": []}, {"Id": "124480138", "PostId": "70373344", "Score": "0", "Text": "There is no such tool.
